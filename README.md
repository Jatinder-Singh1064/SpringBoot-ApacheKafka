# SpringBoot-ApacheKafka
Apache Kafka implementation with Spring Boot application. Created 2 microservices that communicate with each other as Producer/Consumer pattern. Event Driven Architecture is followed where messages are published over a Topic Exchange.

Aside from Apache Kafka, I have used Apache Zookeeper server for distributed coordination between distributed applications. Used Postman for REST API testing and post/get messages.
